  aaaand now I've got your IP

  and it really is that simple. I didn't even have to do anything other than own the hostname. 
  Every request is logged in Cloudflare's Analytics tab, and the IP address of the network you clicked
  that link with is now mine to see. 

  Using the specific "definitely-not-an-ip-grabber" path helps me differentiate these requests 
  (for people that this link would specifically be sent to) from any other regular requests.

  But it really isn't that bad

  Even though I can connect whatever account I sent this link to with a general location in the real world, 
  it does NOT give me anything precise. It gives me the location of your internet provider, but this may not
  even be in the same city or county depending on where you live.

  This information can be used with other context cluse from social media and elsewhere to doxx you, but just
  an IP address isn't going to do very much. Unless you've messed with your router settings and done something
  unwise, I probably couldn't even see anything remotely identifiable if I tried to hack your network.

  To be clear, I'm not doing anything with this information save for maybe a bit with a friend or this PSA.
  Stay safe, use a VPN if you can, and be careful with suspicious links! Virustotal is an excellent tool for
  vetting suspicious files and links. I've linked it below.
