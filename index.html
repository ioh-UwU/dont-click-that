  Aaaand now I've got your IP address.

  and it really is that simple. I didn't even have to do anything other than own the hostname. <br>
  Every request is logged in Cloudflare's Analytics tab, and the IP address of the network you clicked <br>
  that link with is now mine to see. 

  Using the specific "definitely-not-an-ip-grabber" path helps me differentiate these requests <br>
  (for people that this link would specifically be sent to) from any other regular requests.

  But it really isn't that bad

  Even though I can connect whatever account I sent this link to with a general location in the real world, <br>
  it does NOT give me anything precise. It gives me the location of your internet provider, but this may not <br>
  even be in the same city depending on where you live.

  This information can be used with other context cluse from social media and elsewhere to doxx you, but just <br>
  an IP address isn't going to do very much. Unless you've messed with your router settings and done something <br>
  unwise, I probably couldn't even see anything remotely identifiable if I tried to remotely access your network.

  To be clear, I'm not doing anything with this information save for maybe a bit with a friend or this PSA. <br>
  Stay safe, use a VPN if you can, and be careful with suspicious links! Virustotal is an excellent tool for <br>
  vetting suspicious files and links. I've linked it below.
